//And this is the question
now this is the question (You are given an array of n integers a1,a2,…,an. You are allowed to perform the following operation once.
* Select an integer x (which may be negative), and for each value i (1≤i≤n), set ai=ai+x.
For example, if a=[1,3,4,2], and you perform the operation with x=3, a is now equal to [4,6,7,5].
Output the maximum possible value of MEX(a)∗ after the operation is performed.
∗MEX(a) is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. For example, MEX([1,2,0,5]) is 3, and MEX([1,2,4,9]) is 0.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤3000) — the length of array a.
The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (−109≤ai≤109) — the array a.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3000.
Output
For each test case, output the maximum possible value of MEX(a) after the operation has been performed.) and this is the test case (6
